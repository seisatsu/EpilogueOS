# EpilogueOS
An ESP8266/ESP32 FreeRTOS-based mesh-networking operating system based on uLisp and FreeRTOS.
Currently in Pre-Alpha.

EpilogueOS will offer multiple shell sessions as separate FreeRTOS tasks, as well as user and filesystem management.

The end goal is a general purpose LoRa mesh networking solution.
